# Summary
The results are clear and portrayed as expected. In Urban areas there are more people, more money, and more drivers, which in term, explains why the total fares are the highest, the drivers are the most, and there are the most rides. Followed by the 2nd most of everything in Suburban areas, which are 2nd most populated areas. And Last, as expected, Rural areas had the least amount of drivers and the least amount of rides. However, it is important to note the average costs of rides are higher in rural areas because of supply and demand. Less people, and less drivers means the cost per ride will be higher. 

A few notes for the analysis**
The data could have been more detailed with ranges of what qualifies as Rural, Suburban, and Urban areas. Knowing Land areas would set boundaries for labeling places where data was received. Also, knowing how big Populations in the areas are will better see how in the communities this transportation businesses will be used and how much potential for growth there is. Knowing income in the areas as well will better see if a driving service will be needed.  As well as diving deeper into finding more data, if someone is to incentive more rides to rural areas, offering loyalty programs, coupons, and marketing could potentially encourage more people to become drivers and/or riders.
